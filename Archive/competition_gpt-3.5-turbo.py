    "doc": "A Raspberry Pi is a small, affordable, and versatile computer that was designed for educational use. It comes in various models with different features; the most popular being the Model B+ which offers four USB ports, an Ethernet port and up to 1GB of RAM. The cost of a Raspberry Pi depends on the model chosen; prices range from $35 - $55 USD depending on specifications such as RAM size, storage type etc. This makes it very accessible for both hobbyists and businesses alike who are looking for an inexpensive computing solution or just want to experiment with coding projects. The Raspberry Pi can be used to control home automation systems or build your own robots â€“ anything you would need a basic PC capable of doing!"
